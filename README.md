# The Project

Shuffle among your Spotify's playlist with accuracy.

demo here üî• (optimize for mobile üì±) : https://shuffle-spotify-svelte.netlify.app

I implement the iOS (üçé) version of the mobile Spotify app.

# Technologies

Svelte (+SvelteKit) : I üíö Svelte since I try it after learning React & Vue.
I love the simplicity & the conventions.

Vite : I was impressed when Evan You (creator of Vue.js) has demonstrated this new tool... Because I love Vue, I also decided to give it a try.

CSS : I use native CSS instead of pre-processors (e.g. sass, stylus...)
